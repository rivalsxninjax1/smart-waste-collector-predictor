# Smart Waste Collection Predictor

A unique machine learning solution designed to optimize urban waste management. This project predicts whether a trash bin in an urban area will soon be full and require pickup. The goal is to help waste management services optimize collection routes and schedules, leading to cost savings, reduced fuel consumption, and more sustainable urban environments.

## Problem Statement

As cities grow and urban populations increase, efficient waste management has become critical. Traditional methods of waste collection can be inefficient—trucks may collect bins that are not full while missing those that are overflowing. Our solution uses a machine learning model to predict if a trash bin will require pickup soon. By considering factors such as current fill level, weather, traffic, and population density, the model helps optimize collection schedules.

## Project Structure

- **smart_waste_predictor.py**:  
  The main Python script that generates synthetic data, trains a machine learning model (RandomForestClassifier), and evaluates its performance.
  
- **README.md**:

## Dataset

In this project, we use an imaginary (synthetic) dataset created using Python's `numpy` and `pandas` libraries. The dataset includes the following features:
- `fill_percentage`: Current fill level of the trash bin (0 to 100%).
- `temperature`: Ambient temperature (°C).
- `precipitation`: Rainfall in the last hour (mm).
- `traffic_index`: Traffic congestion index (1: light, 10: heavy).
- `population_density`: Number of people living near the bin (persons/km²).
- `hour_of_day`: The current hour (0 to 23).

The target variable is `needs_pickup`, where a value of `1` indicates that the bin is likely full and requires pickup, and `0` indicates otherwise.
